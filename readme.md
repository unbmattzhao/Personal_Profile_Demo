## The use of Github 

I uploaded my assignment link via Github website, I felt at least for now, it seemed to be more convenient for me. 

However, after reading the comments on my week-one's I realized it was more practical for programmers to use Git to manage the repos and codes and the benefit was obvious. It's kind of mind-set changing for me.

I set up this branch and submit the changes made on local machine via Git, not only to share with you what I have learnt about Git / Github, also to share with you my understanding on my learning process.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
